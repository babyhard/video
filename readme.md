Babyhard.com uses ss as a pass to provide a decentralized adult video sharing platform based on Ethereum+IPFS. It is completely anonymous, has no review mechanism, data and user information is stored in Ethereum, and files are stored in IPFS. The entire DAPP is completely static and decentralized. Users can access it through http or ipns. At present, the project is still in the testing stage but the video can be watched or shared normally. Before the charging mechanism is added, the video data smart contract is reduced. Deployed in the Rinkeby network of Ethereum, the gas generated by video information and user reviews is paid by the project party and is completely free to users.
